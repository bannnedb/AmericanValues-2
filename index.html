<h2>What is AmericanValues 2?</h2>
    <p>AmericanValues is a political quiz inspired by <a href="https://8values.github.io/">8values,</a> but tailored to the political climate of the United States. AmericanValues 2 is a continuation of that test, made by me, u/_bannned_ on reddit. You will be presented by a statement, and then you will answer with your opinion on the statement, from <b>Strongly Agree</b> to <b>Strongly Disagree</b>, with each answer slightly affecting your scores. At the end of the quiz, your answers will be compared to the maximum possible for each value, thus giving you a percentage. Answer honestly!<br /><br />
    There are <b><u><span id="numOfQuestions"></span></u></b> questions in the test.</p>

<h2>What are the American values?</h2>
    <p>There are six independent axes - Culture, Community, Foreign, Governmental, Judicial, and Federal - and each has two opposing values assigned to them. They are:</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#0288d1;">Progressivism</b> (Culture)<br/>
        Those with higher Progressivism scores believe the American way of life is morally wrong due to being too conservative and needs to be fundamentally changed in a modernist context.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#d32f2f;">Conservatism</b> (Culture)<br/>
        Those with higher Conservatism scores believe the traditional American way of life is preferable to modernity, they may object to the American tradition, but do so in a conservative or reactionary context.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#D15585;">Collectivism</b> (Community)<br/>
        Those with higher Collectivism scores believe all Americans should work together to solve their problems and tend to favour socialism or social democracy.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#fbc02d;">Individualism</b> (Community)<br/>
        Those with higher Individualism scores believe each American should solve their own problems independently and tend to favour capitalism.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#7CD1FF;">Globalism</b> (Foreign)<br/>
        Those with higher Globalism scores believe America should do more to help foreigners and work with other countries.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#f57c00;">Isolationism</b> (Foreign)<br/>
        Those with higher Isolationism scores believe America should put the interests of Americans above those of foreigners.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#00796b;">Freedom</b> (Governmental)<br/>
        Those with higher Freedom scores believe the government should leave Americans alone and that society should be based around the NAP.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#303f9f;">Authority</b> (Governmental)<br/>
        Those with higher Authority scores believe the government should protect Americans from harm, and believe in the necessity of heving strong authority figures.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#7b1fa2;">Doctrinal</b> (Judicial)<br/>
        Those with higher Doctrinal scores believe the constitution should be interpreted as a living document, changing over time alongside the nation and its people.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#689f38;">Textual</b> (Judicial)<br/>
        Those with higher Textual scores believe the constitution should be interpreted by its actual text, and the intention of its framers.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#a6a6a6ff;">Federalism</b> (Federal)<br/>
        Those with higher Federalism scores believe the states should have more power.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#30CC86;">Centralism</b> (Federal)<br/>
        Those with higher Centralism scores believe the Federal Government should have more power.</p>
<h2>What's the "Closest Match" mean at the bottom of the results?</h2>
    <p>In addition to matching you to the twelve American values, the quiz also attempts to match you to a political ideology. Don't take it too seriously, as it tends to be inaccurate.</p>
